# Traffic Accident Analysis Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook focuses on analyzing a dataset of traffic accidents in the United States, sourced from a comprehensive dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). The notebook includes a series of blocks, each dedicated to different data handling, processing, and feature engineering tasks.

## Notebook Structure
- **Block 1: Importing Libraries and Loading Data**
  - Libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are imported.
  - The dataset 'US_Accidents_March23.csv' from Kaggle is loaded, and its first 5 rows are displayed.
- **Block 2: Basic Data Information**
  - Basic information about the DataFrame is provided, including data types and number of entries.
- **Block 3: Missing Value Analysis**
  - Analysis of missing values in the dataset.
- **Block 4: Data Cleaning**
  - Dropping and filling missing values.
- **Block 5: DateTime Conversion**
  - Converting 'Start_Time' and 'End_Time' to datetime format.
- **Block 6 to 9: Feature Engineering**
  - Creating mappings and categorizing data into new meaningful features.
- **Block 10 to 14: Additional Feature Engineering**
  - Further conversion and categorization of features, including twilight conditions and extracting hours from timestamps.

## Current Implementation Coverage
- **Accident Severity Prediction**: Initial steps towards this goal are evident in the feature engineering blocks, but a predictive model is not yet implemented.
- **Time Series Analysis**: The conversion of dates and times to datetime objects is a preliminary step for time series analysis.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: The notebook includes latitude and longitude data, setting the foundation for potential geospatial analysis.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: The creation of various features like city codes, timezone codes, and twilight codes indicates a movement towards analyzing feature importance.
- **Integrating Vehicle Description Data**: This aspect has not been covered in the current implementation.

## Future Scope
The notebook aims to evolve into a comprehensive analysis tool with the following features:
- Performing detailed **Time Series Analysis**.
- Conducting **Geospatial Analysis** to understand spatial patterns in accidents.
- Analyzing **Feature Importance** to identify key predictors of accidents.
- Developing a model for **Accident Severity Prediction**.
- Integrating **Vehicle Description Data** for enhanced analysis and predictions.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this notebook can be found on Kaggle: [US Accidents (Dec 2016 - Dec 2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents).

## How to Use
- Install Jupyter Notebook and necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy).
- Download the 'US_Accidents_March23.csv' file from Kaggle and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
- Execute each block in sequence for a step-by-step data analysis process.

## Additional Notes
- The notebook is intended for educational and analytical purposes, demonstrating various data processing and analysis techniques.
